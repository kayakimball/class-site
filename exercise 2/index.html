<h1 class="jost">Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
<h2 class="jost">By Dieter Rams</h2>

<h3 class="quicksand">1. Good design is innovative</h3>
<p class="karla">The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, <i>exhausted</i>. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in <i>tandem</i> with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">2. Good design makes a product useful</h3>
<p class="karla">A product is bought to be <b>used</b>. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only <i>functional</i>, but also <i>psychological</i> and <i>aesthetic</i>. Good design emphasizes the <i>usefulness</i> of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">3. Good design is aesthetic</h3>
<p class="karla">The <b>aesthetic quality</b> of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">4. Good design makes a product understandable</h3>
<p class="karla">It clarifies the product's <b>structure</b>. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">5. Good design is unobtrusive</h3>
<p class="karla">Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both <i>neutral</i> and <i>restrained</i>, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">6. Good design is honest</h3>
<p class="karla">It does not make a product more <b>innovative, powerful or valuable</b> than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">7. Good design is long-lasting</h3>
<p class="karla">It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts <i>many</i> years - even in today's throwaway society.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h3>
<p class="karla">Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. <b>Care</b> and <b>accuracy</b> in the design process show respect towards the user.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">9. Good design is environmentally-friendly</h3>
<p class="karla">Design makes an important contribution to the <i>preservation</i> of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>

<h3 class="quicksand">10. Good design is as little design as possible</h3>
<p class="karla">Less, but better - because it concentrates on the <i>essential</i> aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.</p>
