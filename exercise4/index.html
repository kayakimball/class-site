        <h5 class="josefin">I found this exhibition to be an interesting reflection of what qualifies as "turning points" in design. I enjoyed learning about the history behind the emoji and "I ♡ NY" logo, both of which have been integral parts of visual culture. Seeing the Macintosh 128K and the Walkman, made me reflect on how far technology has come since their introductions. We now have small, lightweight personal laptops rather than a large, chunky desktop computer. Now, our music exists almost entirely in digital form, eliminating the need for physical players. </h5>

                <h5 class="josefin">However, not every piece in the exhibition felt like a "turning point" to me. For instance, I liked the Hanging Lamp's concept of inviting the owner to become part of the design process, but I didn't find it groundbreaking or a turning point, as some of the other works on display. </h5>
